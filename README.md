## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.

I have created a Node.js application using MySQL  and Inquirer to do just that. Employee Tracker allows the user to veiw current deparments and employee roles as well as add new departments and employee roles.

## Intsallation

Type the following command into your terminal to start the application:

- npm init -y

-npm i

- node index.js
